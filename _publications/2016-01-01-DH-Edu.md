excerpt: 'We present a teaching proposal for the Diffie â€“ Hellman Key Exchange, an important cryptographic technique that is crucial to the Internet and the World Wide. Despite the fact that it builds on advanced knowledge of mathematics, we support that, at its core it consists of processes that are easily understood by Senior High School students. To this end we cite analogies from the bibliography and everyday life and analyze potential benefits and problems. '
