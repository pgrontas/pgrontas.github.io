excerpt: 'We present a teaching proposal for the computation of the maximum value of an element in a set using computational thinking concepts.  The problem selected is simple enough so that it can be understood without the need for intricate examples that might divert studentsâ€™ attention. Furthermore, it can illustrate, in a straightforward way, important computational thinking principles, applicable in all phases ranging from problem analysis to coding.    '
