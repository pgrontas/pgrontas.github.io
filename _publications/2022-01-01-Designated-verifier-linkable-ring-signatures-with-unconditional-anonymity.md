excerpt: 'We propose Designated-Verifier Linkable Ring Signatures with unconditional anonymity, a cryptographic primitive that protects the privacy of signers in two ways:
Firstly, it allows them to hide inside a ring (i.e. an anonymity set) they can create by collecting a set of public keys all of which must be used for verification.
Secondly, it allows a designated entity to simulate signatures thus making it difficult for an adversary to deduce their identity from the content of the exchanged messages.
Our scheme differs from similar proposals since the anonymity guarantees are unconditional.'
