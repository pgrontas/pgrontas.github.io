excerpt: 'This ctextbook explores the theoretical and practical foundations of modern cryptography. It begins with a historical overview and classical cryptosystems, then builds up through essential mathematical tools such as number theory, group theory, and probability. Then it delves into:

Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptosystems: Including DES, AES, RSA, ElGamal, and more.

Digital Signatures: Their definitions, implementations, and advanced variants.

Hash Functions: Their properties, applications, and cryptographic significance.

Cryptographic Protocols: Covering commitment schemes, secret sharing, secure computation, and homomorphic encryption.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Formal definitions, protocols, and real-world applications.

Modern Applications: Such as electronic voting, anonymity protocols, digital currency (e.g., Bitcoin), and code obfuscation.

Advanced Topics: Including quantum cryptography, elliptic curves, bilinear pairings, lattice-based cryptography, and fully homomorphic encryption.'
