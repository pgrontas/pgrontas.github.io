excerpt: 'We propose an e-voting protocol based on a novel linkable ring signature scheme with unconditional anonymity. In our system, all voters create private credentials and register their public counterparts. To vote, they create a ring (anonymity set) consisting of public credentials together with a proof of knowledge of their secret credential via our signature. Its unconditional anonymity prevents an attacker, no matter how powerful, from deducing the identity of the voter, thus attaining everlasting privacy. Additionally, our protocol provides coercion resistance in the JCJ framework; when an adversary tries to coerce a voter, the attack can be evaded by creating a signature with a fake but indistinguishable credential. During a moment of privacy, they will cast their real vote. Our scheme also provides verifiability and ballot secrecy.'
