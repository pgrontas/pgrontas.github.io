excerpt: ' This thesis examines electronic signatures from both technical and legal perspectives. It highlights how digital signatures, supported by cryptography and certification authorities, are the most reliable technology for authenticating electronic transactions. However, effective use requires strong legal and regulatory frameworks, which vary internationally. The study compares different global approaches, with a focus on the European Unionâ€™s directive, and concludes that both robust technology and clear regulation are essential for secure and valid electronic transactions'
