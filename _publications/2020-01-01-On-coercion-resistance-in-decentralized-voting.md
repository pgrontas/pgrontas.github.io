excerpt: 'We investigate the problem of coercion resistance in decentralized voting scenarios. To overcome the barrier imposed by universal verifiability we create a new form of a private channel. Our solution builds on a new cryptographic primitive, Conditional Designated-Verifier Linkable Signatures, that combines the anonymity provided by ring signatures with the controlled verifiability of strong designated verifier signatures. Coercion resistance can be achieved by making vote validity conditional to the use of the correct signing key, in a manner similar to using fake authentication credentials. We encapsulate this primitive in a voting protocol and discuss its implications.'
