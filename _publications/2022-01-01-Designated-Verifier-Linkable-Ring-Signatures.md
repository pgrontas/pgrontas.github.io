excerpt:  'We introduce Designated-Verifier Linkable Ring Signatures (DVLRS), a novel cryptographic primitive which combines designated-verifier and linkable ring signatures. Our goal is to guarantee signer ambiguity and provide the capability to the designated verifier to add ‘noise’ using simulated signatures that are publicly verifiable. This increases the privacy of the participants, as it does not allow an adversary to bypass the anonymity provided by ring signatures by using the
content of a message to identify the signer. We model unforgeability, anonymity, linkability and non-transferability for DVLRS and provide a secure construction in the Random Oracle model. Finally, we explore some first applications for our primitive, which revolve around the use case of an anonymous assessment system that also protects the subject of the evaluation, even if the private key is compromised.'
