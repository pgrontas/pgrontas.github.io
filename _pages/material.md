## Cryptography

### Formal Models and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Modern cryptography can be summarized as Formal Models + Security Proofs. In this lecture, we summarize the evolution of the security models for various cryptographic tasks and use the Diffie - Hellman key exchange protocol in order to demonstrate a first security proof.

### Factoring and RSA

This lecture outlines the RSA cryptosystems and its mathematical foundations. We also cover the various attacks that have been mounted on this cryptosystem during its history and analyze the lesson learnt from them. We also cover its secure variations and prove their security.  [Slides](/files/teaching/cryptoFormalModels.pdf)

### Cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem



### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

This is the topic that fascinated me so much that I got into cryptography! Can a person be convinced only about the truth of a statement, without learning anything else! Surpisingly, for all statements of interest (call me NP) the answer is a 

#### ZK-SNARKS

### Digital Signatures

#### Blind Signatures

#### Ring Signatures

#### Advanced topics

### Electronic Voting With Cryptography

The topic of my PhD thesis, in a mega-lesson, parts of which I use both on the undergraduate and postgraduate courses.
Cryptography in voting aims to resolve the impossible dilemma: Can we have public verifiability of an election, while keeping the ballots secret? Paradoxically, the answer is yes! (under assumptions of course). This lecture, describes the solutions, their limitations and the most widely used formal models that are used to reason about them.
