## Cryptography

### Formal Models and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Modern cryptography can be summarized as Formal Models + Security Proofs. In this lecture, we summarize the evolution of the security models for various cryptographic tasks and use the Diffie - Hellman key exchange protocol in order to demonstrate a first security proof.
