Hello! I am Panagiotis Grontas, a computer science teacher and researcher.

My research focuses on cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs that strengthen user privacy while maintaining verifiability and auditability. Such schemes can be used as building blocks for protocols in the area of electronic voting and distributed digital payments systems such as blockchains.

I am also a high school teacher enjoying to reveal the magic of Computer Science to young students.

Here you will find details about my research and my work.

Enjoy!
